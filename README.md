Another small API I wrote with Spring Boot in the context of a to do Application.<br/>
<br/>All endpoints and CRUD Operations were tested thoroughly with Postman. I have included a .json that includes the collection I used in Postman to test the endpoints ("ToDoApp.postman_collection.json"). Just run the App and load the collection into Postman to test. I used IntelliJ for this project!
<br/>What I learned in addition to the last RESTful service I wrote:

- Added basic security by "encrypting" the user's credentials (email and password) to create a random API key for communicating requests.
